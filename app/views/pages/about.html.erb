<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello there! My name is 'Lolu, born couple of decades ago and I am a keen learner of computer related stuffs. Currently I am learning Ruby on Rails to be a full stack web developer using the Rails framework. After this journey, I will be stepping up further by joining the Lamba school online to study full stack web development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJs, C# and couple of other wonderful programming languages. This has been a wondeful journey and I can't wait to start a new career as a software engineer.</p>
